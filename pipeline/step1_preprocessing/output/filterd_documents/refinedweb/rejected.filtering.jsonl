{"text": "And I had Crazy Retired Man Auditing Classes ---- did I tell you the funny stories about him? remind me to tell you about his rant about aliens. No, I'm not kidding. But he was a sweetheart and as long as you could keep him on track he made a lot of good contributions to the class ---- well, he was taking a pottery class along with mine and he made me a mug!\nSee? It is currently decorating my office, but I don't trust his glazing skills enough to actually use it. That's ok; it's pretty. And it makes me want to take cool pottery classes every time I look at it.\nThis semester I have a different little sweetheart, who is out and proud and not only willing to step up and testify on that front but also bring up issues of race and social justice in the class, which is awesome. And he catches whatever little risque jokes or off-color puns I accidentally make but I don't feel like I'm about to get into trouble.\nA while back he asked me some questions after class --- those questions that don't really seem to have a point except for the subtext of \"I like you!\" --- And I have been there with that awkward I-don't-know-what-to-say-to-a-favorite-teacher-but-I-don't-want-the-class-to-be-over situation and totally love that.\nSo the next day he dropped by my office hours with a big plastic shopping bag. \"Dr. Cog, I just wanted to give this to you!\" Awwwwww. So I opened it up, and found ...\nHmm. On the one hand, I totally appreciate this. And I drank them, so it's not like I am worried he was poisoning me or anything. Every day I'd open one and go \"sweet! I don't have to spend any money on my caffeine habit!\" But I also, because I have to overthink everything, wonder if this is making some sort of comment on me, or on my caffeine habit or weight or something.\nBut no! Stop this! Just drink your damn gifts and revel in the fact that you were offered them. If they start offering me whiskey to mix with it, that's when I know I have a problem.\n4 comments:\nOne former student gave me a big jug of homemade maple syrup. :) (Her family makes maple syrup, along with growing farm stuff.) WAY COOL! And soooo yummy!\nI'm still waiting for the Porsche and the diamonds. /nod\nThis is all so so sweet.\nWell, except for the anaphylactic death part.\nOh, just enjoy the goodies. My first - and certainly most memorable - was a bag of comfort food: mac & cheese, diet coke, cookies, candy bars - from a student in one of my very first classes. She brought it by when she found out I was prepping for my MA exams, along with best wishes from all the friends she'd met in that class.\nI've had the occasional student give me perfume or scented lotions, which have a less-dramatic version of the effect of coconut on you (headache, not anaphylactic shock), but nothing more interesting than that. I sort of like the idea that he actually observed your habits and came up with something that fit them (well, at least until he shows up on your doorstep at midnight one night, but that doesn't seem likely)."}

{"text": "IPv4 Allocation Policy\n1) Abstract\nThis document describes the guidelines for IPv4 address allocation and assignment in the AFRINIC service region (Africa and Part of the Indian Ocean) .They have been developed through an open, bottom up policy development process of AFRINIC's Policy Working Group.\n2) Introduction\nAFRINIC (The African Network Information Center) is a non-for-profit independent organisation serving as one of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR's). Its service region incorporates the African continent and part of the Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros). AFRINIC is responsible for the allocation of IP (Internet Protocol) address space, AS (Autonomous System) Numbers and management of reverse domain names within the region.\n3) Scope\nThis document describes policies for the responsible management of unique IPv4 address space in the AFRINIC region. The policies in this document apply to all IPv4 allocations and assignments within the AFRINIC service region and must be implemented by all AFRINIC's Local Internet Registries.\nThis document does not describe policies related to IPv6, AS numbers, private addresses and in-addr.arpa domains. These policies can be found at\nIt does not describe conditions of AFRINIC membership decribed at nor does it examine the policies of the other Regional Internet Registries.\n4) IPv4 address space\nFor the purpose of this document, IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary numbers (used as identifiers in the IPv4 protocol) and are usually in three types:\na. Public/global IP addresses that are assigned to be globally unique according to the goals described in section 6 of this document..\nc. IP ranges reserved for experiments: These are described in RFC3330 (). Some ranges are also reserved for multicast.\n5) Hierarchy of address space distribution\nIP addresses are distributed in an hierarchical structure in which IANA (The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates address space to AFRINIC, to be redistributed throughout the African region. AFRINIC allocates address space to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and also delegates to them the authority to make assignments and sub-allocations. LIRs sub-allocate and assign address space to their customers in accordance with the policies and procedures described in this document.\n6) Definitions\nThe following terms and their definitions are of particular importance to the understanding of the goals, environment, and policies described in this document.\n6.1 Internet Registry (IR)\nAn Internet Registry (IR) is an organization that is responsible for distributing IP address space to its customers and for registering those addresses. IRs are classified according to their primary function and territorial scope within the hierarchical structure.\n6 four RIRs: APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC. AFRINIC is the fifth\n6.\n6.4 Allocation\nTo \"allocate\" means to distribute address space to LIRs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.\n6.5 Sub-Allocation\nTo \"sub-allocate\" means to distribute address space (by LIRs) to ISPs for the purpose of subsequent distribution.\n6.\n6.\n6.\n7) Goals of the Internet Registry System\n7.1 Goals\nIt is AFRINIC's primary duty, as a custodian of a public resource, to ensure that for all Ipv4 allocations and assignments, the following goals are met:\n- Uniqueness - In order that each host on the public internet can be uniquely identified, each public unicast IPv4 address must be globally unique.\n- Registration - Every assignment and allocation of public Internet address space must be registered in the AFRINIC whois database. This is necessary to ensure uniqueness and to provide information for Internet trouble shooting at all levels.\n- Aggregation - Distributing Ipv4 addresses in a hierachical manner permits the aggregation of routing information. This helps to ensure proper operation of internet routing, and to limit the expansion of Internet routing tables (RFC2519).\n- Conservation - To maximize the lifetime of the public Internet address space resource, addresses must be distributed according to actual need and on the basis of immediate use. Therefore, stockpiling of address space and maintaining reservations must, in general, be avoided.\n7.\n7.3 Documentation.\n7.4 Fairness\nAll policies and practices relating to the use of public address space will apply fairly and equitably to all existing and potential members of AFRINIC regardless of their location, nationality, size,or any other factor.\n8) Registration Requirements\na) All communication with AFRINIC will be in English.\nb) All allocations and assignments will be registered in an AFRINIC database. Any unregistered assignemnts / allocations / sub-allocaion will be considered invalid. The registration data (name, IP block/range, contacts, status, etc..) must be correct at all times. This is necessary to support network operations.\nAllocation policies and guidelines\n8.1 Introduction\nAFRINIC allocates ranges of IPv4 addresses to Local Internet Registries (LIRs). LIRs reassign or sub-allocate that space to their customers.\nAn Allocation is a range of IPv4 addresses from which sub-allocations and assignments are made. All LIR's assigning address space allocated from AFRINIC are also advised to adopt a set of policies that are consistent with the policies described in this document.. (CIDR - \"Classless Inter-Domain Routing\", is exlained in RFC1517-1959,)..\n8.2 First Allocation\na) AFRINIC's minimum allocation is /22 or 1024 IPv4 addresses.\nb) The organisation must be an AFRINIC member in good standing, and\nc).\n8.3. Slow start mechanism for first allocations\nAFRINIC shall apply a slow start mechanism to all new LIRs. With respect to allocations made by AFRINIC, the first allocation an LIR receives will be the size of the minimum practical allocation described in Section 8.2 (a) unless otherwise justified.\nThe slow start policy is used by all RIR's to prevent allocations of large blocks of address space that may then remain substantially unassigned. AFRINIC implements the slow start mechanism in a consistent and fair manner for every LIR, and will apply the same principles and standards to every applicant for address space.\n8.4 Additional Allocation.\nAFRINIC will always try to allocate contiguous address ranges, allowing the LIR to minimise the number of route announcements it makes. However, it will not always be possible to allocate a range contiguous with the LIR's previous allocation.\n8.5 Sub-Allocations\nThe minimum size of a sub-allocation is /24. It allows a reasonable number of small assignments to be made by a downstream ISP. An LIR may not sub-allocate IPv4 space above its suballocation).\n9) Assignment policies and guidelines\nLIR's must request approval from AFRINIC approval for all sub-allocations above their Sub-Allocation Window (see section 10.0 for SAW policy).\nThe following guidelines are intended to help LIRs and end-users in their search for equitable compromises:\n9.1. Request forms are available at\nWhen making sub-allocation from their SAW, LIR's should also ensure that such information is given by the end-user.\n9.2.\n9.3 Utilisation\nImmediate utilisation of assignments should be at least 25% of the assigned space. After one year, unless special circumstances are defined, it should be at least 50%.\n9.4.\n9.5.\n9.6.\n10) Sub-Allocation Window (SAW)\nAn sub-allocation window (SAW) refers to the maximum number of IPv4 addresses that the LIR may sub-allocate to the end-users without seeking approval from AFRINIC. The SAW size is expressed in CIDR notatation.\nAFRINIC will review sub-allocation made by the LIR's using their SAW in to ensure that policies are followed correctly. LIR's should also ensure that documentation for sub-allocation made using the SAW be similar to that requested for larger requests.\nBelow are a few guidelines for the SAW:\n10.1 All new LIRs have a SAW of zero. All sub-allocations will need prior approval by AFRINIC.\n10.2 The LIR cannot make any sub-allocation to the end-user above their SAW in a 12 months period (1 year). At the end of a calendar year from the approval of an SAW, the SAW is refreshed for one more year. In case the LIR's SAW is exhausted for a particular end-user, approval must be sought from AFRINIC for any other sub-allocation to the same end-user.\n10.3.\n10.4.\n12) Abbreviations\n- AFRIN Aggregateable\n- PI Provider Independent\n- RIR Regional Internet Registry\n13) Useful links\n- RFC documents:\n- IANA web site:"}

This is Spinal Tap\nHosted by the awesome LG Keltner, we are to post about our writing beginnings.\nWant to know how CassaStar began?\nThere were many influences. I was always a Star Trek fan. Star Wars came along and redefined movies and space operas. I enjoyed the likes of Bradbury and Heinlein.\nAnd then, a single image for an upcoming TV series caught my attention:\nFrank Frazetta’s artwork for the series Battlestar Galactica.\nWhat ignited my imagination was the setting – a rocky planet and a downed ship. The characters, stranded and ready to defend themselves, also caught my attention. (And in the central character, you can probably see the beginnings of Byron.) I imagined two people, a pilot and a navigator, their fighter shot down on a rocky planet and forced to make a sacrifice.\nThat scene, written when I was a teen, was the only part of the original story to survive. (And the scene changed some during the rewrite.) But that image ignited the story behind CassaStar, which eventually became my first published book. Now it’s an Amazon Best Seller and has spawned two sequels.\nA picture really is worth a thousand words!\nExcited about the new books and blogfests? Are you picking up Adversarius? Get any of the movie trivia right? And how did your writing begin?\nDon’t forget to visit M. Pax’s Spacedock 19!\n149 comments:\nYou had some great influences there. Thanks for participating in my blogfest! And your new header is awesome!\nI enjoyed learning about the motivation for CassaStar! Your new header looks great Alex! Jeremy did a terrific job. Congrats to the authors, and I'll have to check out some of these blogfests.\nJulie\nWow, your new header caught my attention right away - it's awesome!\nNice to find out where it all started. The new header is very eye catching - well done Jeremy!\nI missed the last Got Green? blog hop, so I'll be taking part this time. Should be a blast!\nThanks for the shout out!\nLove the header!\nAnd yes, Frazetta is the man.\nMmm... I started writing \"poetry\" (i.e. silly long rhymes) when I was seven or eight.\nFirst novel started when a character walked into my head while I was reading. I was thirteen. :-D\nIt's amazing that one picture can inspire so much, and that in itself is inspiring. :)\nCool new header!\nLots of great blog fests and links today. Jeremy is so talented! I'll hit M. Pax soon. I'm not surprised to see Battlestar Galactica being a major influence for Casastar. :)\nGreat to hear the beginnings of Cassastar! I think pictures can be really inspiring, too...I've frequently wished I could draw instead of write. :)\nI love the header!\nI can see how that picture would inspire you. Neat beginning!\nThis is Spinal Tap is so awesome. Thanks for the heads up about the Overcoming Adversity blogfest.\nStar Trek was the thing that inspired me to create stories as well :)\nLove that echo of Battlestar G in your story - awesome!\nLG, thanks for hosting!\nNick, you're welcome.\nCiara, you can probably see that really easily!\nHey there!\nI love your new header. When it's time for a new look I think I'll contact Jeremy too! I'll treat myself when I hit a certain number of page views!\nYour new header is AWESOME!!!!!!!! Really, really, really cool. It feels like a videogame in here now!\nCongratulations to Mel and all the authors with new books. And Alex, nice to hear about your inspiration. I love hearing how books began.\nLove the new header! And Frazetta has inspired a lot of folks, I think. You're in great company there.\nLove the awesome header! Beautiful work, Jeremy.\nEnjoyed your interview over at Spacedock 19 with Mary. Yes, please discuss cloning next. :)\nCongrats on the new releases, Hilde, Becca, and Mel.\nFrazetta is head and shoulders above everyone else when it comes to those sorts of paintings.\nLike the new look!\nI love that you've had the story all these years and finally acted on it to such success. Very inspiring for another late starter. Though only in my actual writing. My story premises are much more recent.\nI should've known A Fish Called Wanda. I love that movie! And I love Frank Frazetta. He's one of the few artists I used to try to emulate.\nI'm loving Frazetta's picture. It's mezmerizing. I think it's awesome, too, that you wrote a scene as a teen, with the picture as your inspiration for CS, Alex. Very cool.\nThanks as always for all the tasty bites of info. I'll be checking out the blogfests.\nxoRobyn\nAs always-- great information. The new header looks fantastic.\nI also liked Galactica. Never missed it. I think it was movies who inspired me to start writing too. Movies and way too much time alone.\nJolie, he does a great job.\nCathy, like a videogame - funny!\nLaura, cloning is on the list.\nDonna, it's never too late.\nRobyn, that scene was just so powerful.\nGreat Battlestar Galactica picture! This series is one of my favourites.\nInteresting to know how Cassastar came about. Great post.\nYvonne.,\nI absolutely LOVE your new header. Wow. Cool. And the fact that that teaser picture for Battlestar Galactica was the impetus for CassaStar is fascinating. So amazing how inspiration strikes. And I am dying to read How I Fell for the Funny Fat Girl. So many books, so little time...\nWhoa! That header is totally awesome!\nLove to hear how CassaStar came into being.\nOh, hey, did you know that Indie Life thing I did today was inspired by you? Not my thing in it, but the people that put that together were inspired by you.\nLove the new header, Alex! I'm heading over to Spacedock 19 now. :)\nWow! lots of news!\nI enjoyed reading about the beginnings of your first book. Thanks for sharing. :)\nHow cool that an image got you started! It's one of my favorites, too. Sadly, I missed the signup for this blogfest, but I have other surprises in store for today. :)\nFlashy new header!\nAnd interesting to find out your novels were inspired by that artwork.\nDefinitely like the new banner for your blog and also some great info and links. Going to check them out!\nNow I REALLY want to read Adversarius. I shall have to keep my eyes out for this one.\nThank you for sharing the story behind part of CassaStar, I love hearing back stories behind books!\nZoltan, it was a favorite of mine.\nShe'll, just one image started it all...\nAndrew, I did!\nDavid, sorry you missed it.\nLove the header! Inspiration is everywhere if we are just alert and open to it.\nThat is a really cool image - I can see why it inspired your writing!\nFrank Frazetta is an amazing artist. I'm going to his Website now and spend some time just looking at his images.\nAnd good luck to all the writers and their new releases! 2013 is going to be a great year!\nLove the pic and the story behind CassaStar! Pictures are inspiring. I'm saving the date for your fest and Mark's.\nAnd my writing started with the story of a dancing hat . . .and then another about a pencil that escaped from school. (elementary school stories influenced by my love of tap dancing movies, and my strong dislike of school)\nCongrats to ML!\nHeader is awesome :) And that picture is awesome; definitely inspirational... hehee, so punny. Congrats on all the books!\nA picture is worth a thousand words indeed. Will read your guest post and thanks for keeping us informed.\nI love the new header! Thanks for the news. I'm totally gonna check out Nick's blogfest, and I can't wait to read REASONS.\nAl, I do like your new header. Jeremy was done a very, very appropriate job. It evokes a very CassaNinja feel.\nI am curious about your blogfest, and Mary Pax, Nicki Elson and I will be announcing one for March 1 this Friday, too.\nAs for the beginnings of CassaStar, I love that a picture was literally worth a thousand words. And I was also interested to know that the first scene was written in your adolescence! I like that detail very much, the idea of an entire world pulsing with promise since then.\nThat BSG picture is fantastic.\nLove the new header. Signed up for Nick's blogfest. I can see Byron in that picture! I'm getting reallly frustrated. Choosing to read \"CassaStar\" to my kids was a wrong move. I read to them at bedtime, and at best get a chapter in before they zonk. Sometimes I sneak and read ahead...but don't tell them!\nAs an old school BSG fan, I'm amazed that I've never seen that picture before....very cool!\nI always find it very interesting how just one spark can ignite something bigger.\nBetter writing through chemistry :)\nNice header, Jeremy!\nI'm keeping away from blogfests until April--at least that's my plan. My last couple of weeks with illness and holidays have already set me a year behind in blogging. Please don't come up with any blogfests I can't refuse!\nLee\nTossing It Out\nI do love your new header! It amazes me how much things happen every week. I feel so left behind.\nSo awesome to hear the story behind that! I've always wondered. Can't wait for your blogfest announcement :)\nYou new header rocks. Love the flash, Alex. Fits with your uniqueness!\nGreat looking header. It's good to hear how it all began for you too.\nWhat a fun new header!\nGreat new header! and thanks for all the updates. Best :)\nLots of stuff going on. Always good to come over here to catch up, and find out yet another interesting fact.\nAlthough I'm an avid Bradbury reader (and a couple of Heinlein), and loved BG, I write totally different stuff. Thank goodness for authors like you who feed my addiction to that genre.\nLove the new header! Great job, Jeremy. That is cool that BSG inspired you, and that you wrote the first scene as a teen!\nYes I like your new header! Jeremy is really good at creating headers that capture the tone of the blog.\nSO techi... so interesting, such fun! Both you and your header.\nThe cool factor on that banner is very high! One of my buddies approach to painting mini's is inspired by Frazetta.\nNice new banner! I love the golden-brown color scheme.\nI've been writing since I was 4 years old, literally as long as I could write. It's just what I've always done, no special inspiration to have started.\nI love the new header, Alex! I've been to Spacedock 19 - I'm on my way:)\nCool new header and interesting how one picture can spark an entire series!\nStephen, you could get lost at that site...\nTyrean, a dancing hat! That is definitely original.\nSuze, excited to hear about your blogfest! Yes, there was a really crappy first draft of CassaStar written in my teen years, all stemming from that one scene.\nMark, I think the black and white version was in the old TV Guide magazine.\nLee, you might not be able to refuse mine...\nClarissa, it amazes me as well.\nJoylene, thank you!\nML, I'm trying.\nCarrie-Anne, that's a long time...\nOff to visit M-Pax!\nLiked to BG artwork :). Hadn't seen it before. Great seeing your inspiration for the start of the Cassa series.\nCool backstory on your book, Alex! And congrats to all the writers in today's post - there's a lot of exciting news swirling about the blogosphere.\nWell, it was ST:TNG for me when I was in middle school, though I'd watched the original series and the original Battlestar Galactica in reruns with my dad. I also used to page through my dad's Frank Frazetta art book (though I think there was stuff in there young kids weren't supposed to see).\nVery cool that your scene survived all those years (and revisions), Alex.\nML's cover looks awesome!\nIt was fun and enlightening to talk to you Alex. Glad you visited the Spacedock. Your clones are welcome any time.\nLove the new header! And Congrats to ML!\nThat picture is very inspiring. I loved BSG - the original and the remake.\nI thought something looked different over here ;) Thanks for the mention, too! You rock!\nAnd I think the only images that have inspired me are ones of hot guys without their shirts on. That counts, right? :)\nCongratulations!\nYour new header is an inspiring eye-catcher.\nA picture really is worth a thousand words!\nI work together with people from different countries and I can't count how often we use pictures.\nM Pepper, I bet there was a lot you shouldn't have seen! Oh well.\nEmily, the only one that did.\nMary, thanks for having me.\nBecca, you are welcome!\nThanks for the information; you are like the Blogger Times:D\nI got my Writer's Creed badge, and am off to visit the Beginnings Blogfest, M. Pax, and all the other goodies you have lined up for us.\nooh! Fancy new header is fancy! Blinking lights and everything!\nLove the new header.\nI started writing back in the dark ages to amuse my friends. It was supposed to be a novel but everyone wanted to be a character, and everyone wanted their character to do this and that, so it ended up being a sprawling continuing story that was still going when my dad got transferred during my senior year (oh, the agony of it all) and we had to move.\nYes, exquisite headboard, love the dynamic light shows.\nI love what Jeremy did for your blog header. Very cool--much like Jeremy himself.\nI like the sound of Adversarius and the hero's code of honor. I'll be checking that out for sure!\nHope your week is going well, Alex!\nBlessings, my friend.\nThe header is really neat!\nI loved the old Battlestar. And had such a crush on Richard Hatch.\nAlex,\nI did like how the header came out as I described it as... Space battle in the Matrix... thank you for letting me be creative.\nSo many things going on today, I enjoyed the Battlestar... I as a kid had a cardboard Viper, that I sent in for from the back of cereal box... oh the memories.\nGreat Day!\nJeremy\nThe new header is awesome! I'm already signed up for Nick's blogfest, but I'll have to pass on Mark's for a very good reason. I'll be here! :D\nCongratulations to Hildie, Becca Ann, and M.L.! I'm off to visit M. Pax now. :)\nSo interesting hearing your inspiration!\nFinally some trivia I knew (well 2 questions anyway).\nNot a big sci/fi fan, but I loved Battlestar Galacticia (the original TV)\nI do like the new header! Thanks for all the news and notes. Appreciate you keeping us in the loop. I know I'd totally be out of that loop otherwise! :)\nI love the header! I see animated pirate ships in my future. :D Thanks for the shout out, Alex!\nAnd my writing started after I created Kayta for a D&D game. Geek to the core! XD\nMy first writing experience was when I was 8, but my real writing experience was probably when I joined my current writing group 10 years ago. Everything I write comes out twisty and dark no matter how I try the opposite. Horror it is! LOL.\nFrank Frazetta’s artwork is amazing. I used to paw all over it when I was young. I get a lot of my writing inspiration from art as well.\nThere is so much to do and see that I'm not sure what I'm doing next! Love the new header Alex. A million thanks for my book shout out. Have a beautiful day!\nEdi, hoping you'll enjoy those last thousand words.\nSarah, I know - it rocks!\nLD, you should dig it up.\nSia, he IS cool.\nJeremy, that's funny. And the header rocks.\nCarrie, yes, you will be my guest that day!\nMel, you're welcome. And you need to have him do that. Spruce up your header while keeping the ships and the feel.\nLynda, I pawed over it as well, but I'm sure for a different reason.\nHildie, you're welcome!\nThanks for the secret origin of the Cassan universe!\nDunno how you keep up Alex. Liked the sound of Adverstarius so bought it for my Kindle.\nLove your new header. Very flash.\nNo good at movie trivia. Don't get to see too many movies.\nInteresting how Cassa Star began.\nLove that picture. I never missed an episode of the original Battlestar Galactica.\nI believe I have some of his artwork on collector's cards. Fascinating artwork that really drew my eye. I found them in a little shop in a tiny town near the coast of Oregon (while looking for X-Files cards, haha). I do love inspiration in all forms. Wonderful to hear where CassaStar came from.\nShannon at The Warrior Muse\nLove the new header. Very cool. And I think it's amazing how your whole life was essentially changed by that picture. Think about it. The blog. All these people. How much would be the same if you'd never seen that and never decided to write Cassa Star? Maybe it all would've happened in some other way, but you never know.\nI think that's the best thing about life. How even the most innocuous-seeming things (like a picture) can impact you for years to come. :)\nToo much going on! AH!\nIt's all good though.\nNice getting a glimpse into 'the beginning'.\nThanks for sharing.\nHeather\nJo, I just do my best.\nSusan, I didn't either!\nShannon, that is very cool! I have a game with his artwork on it.\nTamara, none of it would've happened...\nVery cool beginning. A picture or a piece of music an inspire a whole series. I'm off to the Spacedock now!\nAlex, I think you are at the point now that you need this comment box at the top of the comment list instead of the bottom :) That is a very cool header and I like it a lot. I will throw some work Jeremy's way if I decide to go that route at some point.\nHey I got three of the four movies I named, right!! Amazing.\nLots going on this first week or so in 2013!\nNothing like starting with a BANG!!!!!!\nI got one from the trivia! Yeah! Can't wait to stop by M.Pax's blog to check out the post. :)\nCool banner!\n~Stephanie\nChuck, I'll see what I can do about the comment box, And I think one of Jeremy's headers would look awesome on your blog.\nStephanie, glad you got one right.\nIt was nice to read about your motivation for Cassa Star!\nI'll go check out your interview with Pax.\nSome really great blog hops coming up and I'm so stoked for Becca's book! :)\nI love your header!!! Jeremy rocks, flashes and glows ;D\nWhat the heck...a month? C'mon Captain...no fair-I need a hint!\nOff to check out MPax-I miss her~\nI'm so behind, but playing catch up is fun!\nI love how fun and kind your blog is!\nCongrats to all! Mel you rock ;D\nYeah, that image would catch my attention too.\n......dhole\nFranzetta's Battlestar Galactica is epic. Great inspiration Alex.\nLove the new banner. I wondered if Retro Zombie was the creator.\nHard to beat Frazetta, and yes, I can see Byron in that center figure.\nI love how the Cassa trilogy, and by extension this blog, came about because of that single image. It's a pretty awesome way to begin :)\nJamie\nI'm not surprised that a powerful image you saw as kid helped to inspire your novel. The older I get, the more I'm amazed at how much the world we lived in when young still affect us.\nOne of these days, I swear I'm gonna answer all your trivia questions.\nHey, it's cool to know how you got started with CassaStar. I didn't realize you began writing it when you were a teen :)\nOh I read and reviewed Adversarius! It's a great book. Congratulations to Mel Chesley :))\nGreat header! It was interesting reading about what inspired CassaStar.\nDude. Your new banner looks awesome!\nElla, thank you. And I will give you a hint - it involves a top ten list.\nDG, figured you would see Byron.\nJamie, it is wild when you think about it.\nHelena, don't give up hope that you'll answer them.\nRachel, I did! Many, many years ago...\nMichael, you're a speed reader.\nMan I love those moments where inspiration strikes is right on down! :) Nice story for the blogfest. I have yet to read any of your books but they are all high up on my TBR!\nand thousands of fans!\nawesome picture! art is so inspirational!\nfabulous new look! love it!\ncant wait to see what you do next!\nGreat new banner!

And so many blogfests to enter. Congratulations to all that have new books out.\nI love the story behind the inspiration for CassaStar. That image can really stir some creativity, and I'm glad it caught your eye. I have a funny story about my inspiration for Forged by Greed :-)\nI'm off to M Pax's blog to read the post.\nI love the new banner! It's spectacular!\nThe new banner is AWESOME, Alex!!! Love it. =) Going to check out books. =)\nYour new header is great!\nSo what should I do now, shut my blog down or change header?\nI totally identify with using artwork for inspiration! I'm working on a high fantasy project, and I've developed a habit of finding scifi and fantasy pictures on pinterest to help me envision locals and characters and even events for my story. :D\nTrisha, thank you!!\nTara, I hope I have that many fans.\nAngela, you need to post that story.\nJay, or contact Jeremy to do a new one!\nLiesel, smart idea.\nOy! Totally forgot it was Wednesday yesterday. Better late than never. Good thing I dropped by. I'd miss all the news without your posts. So many blogfest! And so little time. I loved the BG from the late 70's early 80's. had big crushes in Apollo & Starbuck. Not surprised you'd find it inspiring. Funny where we find that nugget of inspiration.\nThat's so cool to learn the inspiration behind Cassa Star! I remember when that picture came out! :)\nIt's amazing what can come from a simple picture. I know I've had my fair share of image-based muses. Love the new header. Absolutely gorge!!!\nAlex, the new header is jazzy. I like it.\nIt boggles my mind when I come here and see all these blog posts I want to visit and all these new books I want to read.

{"text": "OberonViking I agree completely with you here. I actually have the trouble of needing to retrain my players as they began by mistrusting me. Probably because they are students at the school I teach at, perhaps becausew they are only 13 and 14, maybe because they have come with a background in computer RPGs and mmorgs.\n– OberonViking 2012-07-06 10:10 UTC\nshortymonster sadly, because I play with a mixed group from various other gaming groups, this kind of untrustworthiness seems to have been firmly established long before I got there. using an NPC as the guy who wired them’s second in command who was supposed to be very helpful indeed, even going behind his boss’s back on occasion for reasons of his own that were all in the player’s interests, and they still thought he was lying or withholding information.\n– shortymonster 2012-07-06 10:18 UTC\nlior An interesting point. On the one hand, we are trying to make the game world dangerous and full of evil. But then we avoid almost all things which are truly evil. We slaughter lots of creatures without problem and are happy when countless villagers are massacred because that is the next adventure hook. But torture, abuse, despair, we do not want to have those in the game. Why should we? If its ugly in the real world, how could it be fun in play?\nThere is something delusional about our hobby.\n– lior 2012-07-06 11:30 UTC\n-C It’s weird, I do this all the time and the players never really have a problem trusting anyone. I’ve never had a player do any of the things. Threaten to torture somebody? Never. Sometimes they’ll say “I don’t want to get screwed!” and I’ll say, “Well, you probably won’t” and that’s pretty much the end of it.\n– -C 2012-07-06 12:28 UTC\n@Lior: I think there is nothing delusional about it at all. It only seems delusional if you make broad simplifications. Let me dig a bit deeper:\nOr:\nOr:\nWe might get into real world ethics, of course (the ends justifying the means, is there a just war, human(oid) rights, war conventions) – but I think the key is how people feel at the table even if they cannot express it clearly.\nThere’s a line to be drawn everywhere with respect to “how much we can take”. Just as we do not experience risk in mathematical terms, we don’t experience cruelty and pain in statistically relevant terms. It matters whether we’re doing it, or it is being done to us, or we hear about other people doing it, the amount of graphic detail is important, our own sensibilities play an important role (people who enjoy watching Saw movies and I are not in the same boat).\n– AlexSchroeder 2012-07-06 12:31 UTC\nAlex takes a couple shortcuts to get to game content he enjoys and is interested in. That is not delusional.\nIt’s a question of where you draw the line in descriptions and where you lift the veil about NPCs. “His eyes dart around nervously as he tells you this” or “you have the uncanny feeling he is not telling the truth” is not the same thing as everybody always being nice, even if they’re supposed to be the bad guys.\nExample: In Alex’ Wilderlands campaign there is a red dragon who got seven virgins every year; the reasons long forgotten by the humans. Yes, the dragon is going to sacrifice these innocent people in a ritual (and that is all I as a player needed to know) ... but the ambiguity of real life starts beyond this; the dragon does this to seal a demon kings’ soul so he doesn’t resurrect himself in this part of the material plane.\nAnd the goal of that subset of the campaign, chosen by the players, was to ensure the dragon doesn’t need to do that anymore. So:\n– Harald 2012-07-06 12:42 UTC\n@-C: If your players never suggested torture, more power to them! What about the other issues, however: When your players release prisoners, the freed prisoners go and fetch friends to chase after the player characters? If so, do the player characters continue to release prisoners? When your non-player characters lie to your player characters, will the players still trust other non-player characters? Perhaps your player characters never trust any non-player characters? Or perhaps sifting through the statements the non-player characters make is part of the game? It also seems to be what you’re saying in On Ignorance of Skill Based Play:\nThis would be similar to me openly admitting that the non-player character seems to be lying once they player ask me “is he lying?” or “I watch his face and try to figure out whether he’s lying.” In response, I’ll provide something pretty obvious like the examples Harald provided above: “His eyes dart around nervously as he tells you this” or “you have the uncanny feeling he is not telling the truth.”\n– AlexSchroeder 2012-07-06 12:45 UTC\nlior @Alex, @Harald: Let me rephrase. We want dragons sacrificing virgins, but we do not want to think about what that would mean and how and why that is horrible. We want a road flanked by dozens of crucified criminals. But we do not want to imagine what that really means. Crucifixion → bad, human sacrifice → bad. Those are trivial conclusions. We want them in the game, but we want them to stay trivial.\nAlso, I did not say Alex is delusional, far be it from me. In fact I think Alex’ method is a mature way of not dealing with unfun issues.\nI am deliberately saying “There is something delusional about our hobby” because I think it applies to almost all of us, myself very much included. I suspect those players who are OK with torture are so because it does not touch them emotionally as easily. In other words, it stays trivial for longer.\n– lior 2012-07-06 13:30 UTC\nAlexSchroeder @Lior: I suspect that this is an aspect of all sane humans and is true for almost all endeavors: too much detail makes you crazy; too much terrible detail makes you crazy. It protects you from the tedium and horror of everything, of the entirety of our human existence. The repression of horrible details and (sometimes) their sublimation into action (or adventure in the case of role-playing games) seems to be one of the most basic mechanisms allowing us to function. But then again, I’m not a psychologist and have my reservations regarding Freud.\n– AlexSchroeder 2012-07-06 14:07 UTC\nBrendan Question: how are lying NPCs different from trapped dungeon rooms? Is it a question of context? If so, maybe NPCs encountered in a dungeon are unreliable, while those encountered in a town are trustworthy? That seems like it might be a reasonable assumption, much like how players usually don’t feel the need to probe the floor in a tavern with a 10 foot pole.\n– Brendan 2012-07-06 22:43 UTC\nAlexSchroeder @Brendan: I think looking at the difference between traps and lying non-player characters is a good way of considering the issue. Context is a good point. I’d say that a non-player character joining the party and moving from the tavern context to the dungeon context warrants a bit more thought: Is the non-player character now a liability or does he “stay trustworthy?” My players might be expecting the character to stay honest and I tend to agree.\nAnother aspect I like is how traps or liars are discovered.\nHere’s how I think traps ought to be used: there must be ways of discovering traps that doesn’t involve rolling dice. I like to say: “If you need to roll dice, it’s already too late.” Thus, examining the floor might yield “a line across the floor” or “a dried puddle of blood” or something along these lines. I like -C’s traps on his Hack & Slash blog because he discusses this discoverability of traps.\nWhat about lying non-player characters? I feel that they need the same kind of discoverability. In the original example on G+ the Philip Watson had the evil cleric drink booze instead of joining combat in the first round and similar hints out there, so as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough.\n– AlexSchroeder 2012-07-07 10:04 UTC"}
{"text": "62 Reasons You Might Be All Groan UpPosted on December 27th, 2011\nAre you a GROAN UP? Someone in that awkward limbo between growing and grown? If so, you’re not alone.\nI recently unwrapped the theory of Emerging Adulthood, which suggests that there is a new developmental stage between the transition from adolescence to adult called “emerging adulthood”.\nHowever, I’ve also been conducting my own less-than-academic research around emerging adulthood and my theory of being a GROAN UP. And after months of collecting answers from twentysomethings/thirtysomethings from around the World of Web-ernet (and sprinkling in my own), I present to you what it REALLY means to be ALL GROAN UP – someone in between growing and grown.\n1. When you buy loads of cute accessories for your teenage sister, because\nobviously you are too GROAN up to wear them! - Kay\n2. The thought of becoming an adult makes you toss up a few Fruity Pebbles.\n3. You see nothing wrong with still eating Fruity Pebbles.\n4. You take your nieces to see cartoon movies just so you don’t look like a weirdo watching a kids movie – Linzy\n5.

You ironed your dress shirts for the first month of your new job, and then decided a much easier strategy was just to stop believing that wrinkles exists.\n18. You say things like, “That Fred Savage was dreamy” ~ Blunt Delivery\n19. You bring empty Tupperware to work to take home leftover office food\n20. When you make comments like “I was NEVER allowed to wear something like that when I was her age...I wore stretch pants and an over-sized t-shirt!” ~ Alyssa\n21. When the last of the ketchup bottle makes a fart noise and you don’t laugh. ~ Julian\n22. You realize on the morning of that Mother’s Day is not just for your mom, but also for your wife, who is now a mom. So you run out and buy a glass swan (I might be speaking from experience here)\n23. You love listening to NPR now. I mean, it’s talk radio! ~ David\n24. You still giggle when someone says balls (maybe just a groan up guy thing)\n25. You go back to your home town and talk about all the “developments” that have happened since you’ve been gone ~ Lindsay\n26. You thought Mary-Kate and Ashley were adorable. And now they kinda scare you. ~ Katie\n27. When you never run out of underwear because you actually stay on top of laundry ~ Ashley\n28. When you’re losing hair and gaining babies.\n29.

You chug two-day old coffee because you’re running late and you know if coffee doesn’t enter, you’re not leaving. (Note to Kid-Self for when time machines become available at Best Buy: Never fight the nap).\n33. You realize that the cliques in high school are alive & well in the real world too ... ~ Jocelyn\n34. You need a vacation to recover from your vacation.\n35. You have a 12 year old say to you, “My youth pastor was talking about Vanilla Ice and my friends and I thought he was talking about an ice cream flavor,” and you aren’t sure whether to laugh or cry because she was completely serious. ~ Lindsay\n36. You get zits on your jawline and think, “Really? Still?” ~ Katie\n37. You think girls today are a bit hoochy but then you see pictures of you with shirts that exposed your belly button ~ Katie\n38.

The only reason you maintain your weight is so you never have to buy new dress pants\n43.

You start saying, “this generation’s music really sucks” ~ Will\n45. You think you’re not that old and then you realize that the kids who just graduated high school this year were born in 1993. ~ Lindsay\n46. You still can’t believe your parents turned your old bedroom into an office. Did your time with them mean nothing? Shouldn’t your bedroom remain a permanent shrine?\n47. When going to bed early on Sunday night to prepare for the week becomes a priority. ~ Ryan\n48. You begin repeating phrases your parent’s always used to say, that you swore you never would. And then deny it.\n49. You utilize your Flex Spending Account, because you know what that is now. ~ Kendra\n50. When your wife complains that you drive like her grandfather just to get better gas mileage. ~ Brandon\n51. When you complain in agony, “when I got my license, it only costs $20 to fill up my car!” ~ Stephanie\n52. Having lower lumbar support has become a major concern.\n53. “Do you have any kids” has somehow become a normal question people ask you. ~ Mike\n54. You now understand what your parents meant when they said, ‘You’ll understand when you get older.’\n55. When you wrinkle your brow and make comments about “kids these days” ~ Kendra\n56. You rake piles of leaves and are about to jump in, but stop because ‘what would the neighbors think’\n57. When you overhear 16 year olds talking about “that lady” and realize it’s you ~ Sarah\n58. Your birthday slowly transitions from best day of the year to worst.\n59. You really want to go sledding again. Until you actually go sledding again. Then you don’t ever want to go sledding again.\n60. You still debate, “Who was hotter – Kelly Kapowski or Topanga Lawrence?”\n61. When you would rather listen to the classical radio station because the alternative radio station “feels” to loud ~ My Brother Chad\n62. You’ve caught yourself saying more than once, “I’m getting too old for this.“\nWhat part of being Groan Up did we leave out? Let us know via comments below.\nSeriously sharing this with everyone I know. Serrrrriously.\nThanks Megan! And thanks for encouraging me to put together this post.\nWhen you reference The Never Ending Story and your intern looks at you like your so out of touch.........FALCOR!!!!!!\nThose silly kids and their lack of appreciation for cinematic masterpieces!\nHaha- these are hilarious! My favorite so far is “you’re losing hair and gaining babies”\nMy own to add is when you find yourself starting a lot of your sentences with “Maybe I’m an old lady, but...” and you’re only 26.\nWhen you start to be annoyed at getting carded buying drinks.\nwhen you start to be annoyed because YOU’RE NOT getting carded buying drinks!\nWhen you FORCE your ID onto anybody selling you alcohol, before they’d even have a chance to ask for it for fear that they might not.\nTwo drinks puts you out of commission for at least the first 5 hours of the next day.\nYou understand more references made by your 50 year old co-worker than your 17 year old niece.\nYou’ve considered buying a mini-van.\nAbby — Too funny! Well said. “You understand more references made by your 50 year old co-worker than your 17 year old niece.” My favorite for sure.\nWhen kids ask why you did something or why they can’t do it...and you tell them that it’s something grownups do.\n.....when having your commute home from work take less time than it usually does due to a lack of traffic congestion is the most exciting thing that happens to you some days.\nWhen you will drive out of your way to avoid having to spend the night at someone else’s house. Sleepovers are zero fun.\nWhen you go to a home decor store and don’t buy anything, strictly because you don’t want to dust it."}

No more Caddies, Trans Ams, Camaros or Mustangs. No Ford or Chevy pick up trucks; no Jeeps or Suburbans. Not one PT Cruiser.\nIs that supposed to be good or bad?\nI kid, I kid. Who could stand to go without seeing the beautiful PT Cruiser in action?\nWhy does this blogger think that these cars would be gone? That's not what would happen if the companies were allowed to go bankrupt. These cars would still be made.\nDon't worry, our salvation is at hand.\nObama will save us all with his plan for a new Civilian Conservation Corps and Work Projects Administration, and that will revive the economy so greatly that we will all be buying up American cars.\nJust imagine all the jobs he will create handing you unemployed people a shovel and telling you to go work a road gang, not to mention all the people working to change light bulbs!\nSo what if the day laborers down at the 7-11 will get all these new jobs building roads and rebuilding school buildings? Your medical records will be on a computer! So that in itself is going to super-charge our economy!\nYes, a new day is dawning!\nWho cares?! Honestly...the Mustang. Does anyone drive those? Anyone besides 16-year-olds in the South? And what's so damned special about the Jeep Cherokee? Chrysler has long since f-ed up the Jeep line. There's what? 15 models now. And they all look the same.\nGet over it. American cars are crap. And not only because they are ugly. But because the people who make them are ugly, too. All those damned union workers making god-knows-what for driving a couple screws are finally about to get what's coming to them. Let them compete in the marketplace. Let them justify $25 an hour plus healthcare plus pension in any other industry.\nGeneral Motors is dead. Long live Toyota. Chrysler is dead. Long live Honda. Ford is dead. Long live Nissan.\nLOL\n\"No Ford or Chevy pick up trucks; no Jeeps or Suburbans. Not one PT Cruiser. All gone...\"\nIsn't that the \"green\" lefty's most orgasmic dream ever? I thought they hated all cars except for the Prius and those ugly little \"Smart\" cars? They should be happy about this! Better get in shape! That 40 mile bike commute is gonna be murder!\nI didn't click on the link because I'm afraid it might not be a joke.\nBetter safe than sorry.\n\"I didn't click on the link because I'm afraid it might not be a joke.\"\nOh it's a joke alright. Not intentionally so, but a joke nonetheless.\n\"What pathogens could possibly be responsible for KOS?\"\nWhatever it is, it certainly isn't the contagious happiness from the other day. marks, the brands, the styles and what have you, are tangibles that will survive, thanks to intellectual property. Sure it may all belong to somebody else, but it will survive. Move along now.\nThe typos are the clue that it's not a joke.\nDetroit faces many challenges. The biggest is: innovate or die.\n\"Rice burning Nissons [sic]\"? Sounds like someone's clinging to \"antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment.\"\n\"all looted by ultra-conservatives eager to punish generations of American workers for the sin of not voting for the GOP in acceptable numbers\"\nI love the logical inversion demonstrated by the above. Yes, they are being \"punished\", how? By not getting the taxpayers to subsidize their excessive compensation packages. What is threatened is that they will have to depend on the health of corporations which their unions squeezed the lifeblood out of.\nTwin,\nThere are a lot of odd things about your post, but I'll just address one of them for now:\nYou wrote:\n\"The simple fact is that cars can be made just as well in 3rd world countries that aren't bound by obscene 40 hour work weeks, consumer- and worker-safety laws, and retirement plans.\nThe American worker is going to have to learn to compete with the cheap labor available in Mexico, Haiti, Bangladesh, and throughout the 3rd world.\"\nThird world countries like, what, Tennessee? We're getting a Volkswagen plant in my town next year and couldn't be more thrilled. And we've lost out on at least a half dozen others who went to neighboring states. The South is just full of non-union, good wages, good benefits \"foreign\" car manufacturers. These are the folks that Detroit can't compete with.\nIn other words, imagine an America without a bunch of shitty, dangerous gas-guzzling cars and trucks, and without a huge bloated, whiny unionized blue-collar workforce.\nYeah, what will we ever do.\nThis is our chance to kill off one of the unions. Let's not pass it up, even if it causes further economic woes. We can ultimately lay the blame where it belongs: at the feet of the middle class. It's wake-up time for the overstuffed American comfort class. No more nanny state for the masses.\nThe middle class has to snap out of it's hippy dippy delusions about \"the American Dream,\" or face the consequences. The global economy simply cannot sustain middle class incomes for a large proportion of the population. The lasting sin of big government/New Deal liberalism was creating the unreasonable expectation that middle class can be sustained at post-New Deal levels. Thanks to the Democrat Party, hundreds of millions of middle class Americans now feel entitled to live in their own homes, have access to world-class health care, and even send their kids to college. That kind of fancy living has never been sustainable for \"the masses,\" as we are learning now. Compare this to India, or China, where 80% of the population lives in poverty, forming a dynamic labor pool that propels their economies.\nThe simple fact is that cars can be made just as well in 3rd world countries that aren't bound by high wages, 40 hour work weeks, heath care coverage, consumer- and worker-safety legislation, retirement plans, and other Democrat-largess.\nThe American worker is going to have to learn, like it or not, to compete with cheap labor from, e.g., Mexico and Haiti. And the American middle class is going to have to shrink back down to sustainable levels. That was the whole point of NAFTA and GATT and the other free trade agreements, and we're finally seeing a long-needed reordering of global economic priorities as a result.\nHistorically dynamic capitalist economies are able to sustain\n— a small class of wealthy (1% or so of the population). This is the productive engine that drives investment, innovation\n— a modest middle class, maybe 5%-10% of the population, to service corporations and the wealth. These are the professionals: doctors, lawyers, skilled tech jobs.\nThe only viable role for the remaining 90%, give or take, is service as a flexible labor market.\nPeople have been doing fine under these conditions for centuries, but the American middle class is at a disadvantage, now, because they've come to expect (feel entitled to) a pampered yet unsustainable middle class existence. The transition to sustainability is going to be difficult for people who have come to expect middle class comfort.\nSo: Let's reorder the economy on a sound basis and take this chance to finally kill off the UAW, and with it the old liberal notion of a broad middle class.\nThis first step will lead to additional course corrections: Once the middle class shrinks down to sustainable levels, ignoring the internal contradictions of Social Security financing will become impossible. Within a few years, the entire system of federal entitlements will implode, liberating our economy once and for all from the restraints placed on it by 80 years of corrupt Dem leadership.\nYup. The end of the line for the big three. Yet Kos misses the point.\nIt won't be the end of the \"American\" auto industry. Just the end of three crappy, bloated companies that pay unionized workers too much money to make inferior vehicles that not enough consumers want to buy.\nOnce the Big Three are bankrupt and gone, the marketplace will have a vacuum. There will be a \"pro-American\" market out there for American-designed, American-built, American-brand cars. Someone will fill the void with a new company. And they will have the opportunity to do so with the benefit of lessons learned from the missteps of Ford, Chrysler and GM. THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is Change You Can Believe In.\nTaxpayer bailouts, on the other hand, hardly represent Change.\nTo people who still think unions are a good idea: this is the pot of chickens coming home to roost.\nThe Mustang is still a great car!\nThe Big 3 is doomed. It is a rotting corpse. Let it die and replace it with foreign manufacturers on American soil.\nEven if the stupid union contracts (including the ones paying people not to work) are torn up, the ultra-generous pension and healthcare plans cannot be supported. There is no way UAW or Congress agrees to cut those. Therefore, thee is no way those get cut. Therefore, they remain a millstone around the Big 3's neck.\nThe Big 3 is a rotting corpse, and Congress just wants to prop it up, maybe inject it with a little juice so it can shamble around aimlessly like some kind of zombie for a few years until it needs another hit of zombie juice (taxpayer dollars).\nWe can only hope that this infection does not spread to other industries. That's the left-wing goal--to turn us into a socialist country by destroying our economy and folding the broken pieces into our federal government. That's why lefties always oppose sound economic policy and always support hoaxes like \"Global Warming.\" They know that to achieve their goals, they must bring America to its knees.\nOf course, in any good zombie movie, you know the ending in advance: we're all f#cked. This is the same way.\nThink about what a great country this is where one can go from potential heiress to the Pierce-Arrow dynasty to starving art school student to tenured law professor at a top tier law school to world-renowned Blog Goddess zipping around in a precision European sports car jobby all in the course of one short lifetime!\nMy country tis of thee!\nI think Congress should bring back the Studebaker, too, just for good measure.\n\"potential heiress to the Pierce-Arrow dynasty\"\nMore like potential heiress to a mechanic shop.\nAnd Meade has the bio and motion picture rights? You lucky bastard!\nPretend it's Cuba.\nThey have kept American cars from the 1950's and earlier going for half a century.\nAfter you are done pretending, start dealing with the 21st century, where America is no longer ascendant in the auto industry.\nIt's called Change. Isn't that what the Kos crowd has been waiting for\n\"And Meade has the bio and motion picture rights? You lucky bastard!\"\nYou may say I'm a dreamer... a lucky bastard dreamer.\nI like to think of myself as an average ordinary blue collar premier myth maker babe magnet.\nSo we've come to the point where someone who thinks a business should stand or fall on its own merits, rather than being nationalized in part or whole, is an \"ultra-conservative\". Not just conservative, an ultra conservative.\nI guess now if you believe in private property and free markets at all, that alone makes you somewhat suspect. I guess in the Obama Nation, the free market is just so yesterday.\nIt's been at least 5 years since the last Trans Am was made.\nNot sure what the connection is between the GOP and the collapsing American auto industry. Ford, GM, and Chrysler have been dying of the same self-imposed illness for 20 years, through both Republican and Democratic administrations. Blaming their plight on anyone but themselves misses the real issue at hand. Forgive us for being skittish about dumping billions more in tax dollars to keep their lights on for another six months when these companies haven't even proven they can run themselves properly.\nThat Pierce-Arrow background seems familiar.\nMy grandfather was a Packard mechanic, who went on to work for himself.\nBut, then the legacies diverge; I bought myself a Packard because I was inspired by pictures of my grandfather next to these big, beautiful cars from the past.\nMy grandfather only had joyful memories of his Packard days--contagious memories for me.\nP.S.\nThanks for losing the typo, I noticed it, but didn't feel like deleting and correcting the comment.\nI love the wishful thinking in \"let the Big 3 die, we'll all Buy Toyota\".\nFirst, why would Toyota build more plants in the USA if the big 3 are gone? They build them now because of the explicit and implicit threat of tariffs and quotas. A threat which will go away, when the big 3 go.\nSecond, once gone the Auto industry will never come back. Goodbye, millions of jobs. Who's going to hire them? Are to they all to be government employees?\nThird, we are now running $500 billion dollar trade deficits with the rest of the world. What are we going to give the Japanese in return for all these shiny new Toyota's? US assets? More worthless dollars?\nThe same people who engineered the subprime fiasco, engineered the $700 wall street bailout fiasco, are now saying we need the big 3 to die. Hmmmm.....\nThe big three should leave the US, find low tax countries with workers who want to work, build cars to sell to the world, be successful.\nWhere to begin with RC's know-nothing comment. Treatises could be written.\nThey build them now because of the explicit and implicit threat of tariffs and quotas.\nNo. They don't. Foreign manufacturers build plants here now because they are profitable. That's why businesses are in business. To make money. Note where the plants are built. Are they built in Michigan, where unions have a stranglehold on the economy? Or are they built in the South, where labor is far cheaper?\nwe are now running $500 billion dollar trade deficits with the rest of the world\nWhy is that, RC? Why has the United States run trade deficits for decades? Is it some conspiracy? No. It's because our currency is strong and our labor is expensive. If your goal is truly to get rid of the trade deficit, the thing to do is to lower labor costs substantially and decrease the cost of our money.\nI don't understand what the problem is with bankruptcy. These are failed businesses. They can't pay their bills. They need to completely change the way they do business. Bankruptcy allows that.\nFinally, I read something the other day that was intriguing. The bailout, rightly, has involved banks. If you want money, go to a bank. That's where all the money from the government has gone.\nRepublicans did not destroy the American automobile industry, and the implication that they did is fatuous. It was destroyed by the UAW and management both assuming that they could be as inefficient as they wished as long as all American manufacturers were more or less equally burdened. It didn't work out. Life's a bitch. It only gets worse for America if we force our economy to drag along a zombie automobile industry. Both UAW and management made the bed. They should now be forced to lie in it.\nI agree RcOcean. It is time to look out for our nation's self-interests.\nWhy doesn't Congress ever discuss the financial incentives the Japaneses auto companies get from their govt? Oh sure Congress delves into the national healthcare in Japan because Dems want that here too. But I an sure the Japanese govt gives plenty of other yen! Plus the Janps and Asians buy very few of our cars? Why is that?\nLet's have an economy that looks like Japan's. So free and growing so much.\nWhile we're at it, let's get a criminal justice system like Japan's, too. Rights, shmights.\nI feel compelled to reiterate something: we will never, ever, ever erase the American trade deficit or even begin to start competing with foreign manufacturers in any industry where wages are high. It's basically a mathematical impossibility.\nHow can people not understand this? You can't expect to sell more of your stuff when it is far more expensive than other stuff that is the same.\nIf you want high wages, you cannot also have a trade surplus. To believe otherwise makes you a moron.\nI must assume that all the military's trucks/ airplanes/ and other assembly line produced stuff will always be available as imports from the friends we have e all over the world. But what if they cause Co2 and have been banned by the UN in the future?\nTraditional -- Certainly, because no American entrepreneur would fill that niche. Never. If these three companies go bankrupt, another American vehicle will never be made. Bankruptcy is death, and birth is not allowed.\n\"My grandfather only had joyful memories of his Packard days--contagious memories for me.\"\nIf you mean to imply that my grandfather was bitter and groused about his misfortune, you are wrong. I never heard him speak about it at all. I have had to imagine the disappointments he had. He never talked about anything like that.\nPrecisely how does our Congress think we could handle another WWII without an auto industry to make the trucks, the tanks and the parts for repair?\nHow does our Congress plan to handle the 1 MILLION pensioners from GM who suddenly don't have a pension? That's one in 300 Americans.\nHow does our Congress plan on handling Michigan loosing another 800,000 jobs like we lost in the past 8 years.. but this time all at once?\nWhat the hell are they thinking? They've given buttloads of cash without hesitation to the financial firms who have used it for bonuses and to buy other foreign companies but STILL AREN'T LENDING money to people to buy cars!\nSeven:\nIs Japan's standard of living significantly lower than ours? If not, how do they produce cars at a lower cost? After we factor in the elimination of the US disadvantage for pensions / benefits.\nRegarding future pension promises that are not funded, Congress is to blame.\nCongress has sat idly by for years while some big businesses and many many state and local govts devised overly generous pensions but did not fund them.\nThat was also a violation of the law of mathematics Seven Machos mentioned.\nWhy is it always assumed that the only alternatives are to bail out Detroit as is, or watch GM, Ford and Chrysler disappear without a trace?\nWhen United Airines went bankrupt did all its airplanes immediately vanish?\nThese companies have contractual obligations with their labor force and dealer networks that are unsustainable. If they are to regain profitability, they need to renegotiate these deals under Chapter 11 protection. Let the bankruptcy laws work as they were intended - there is no pain-free way for the government to \"save\" Detroit.\nSeven,\nIgnoring the fact that a lot of folks won't buy a car from a company in bankruptcy, and ignoring the fact that bankruptcies drag on for a long time; are you suggesting that Chapter 11 (w/o the gov financing anyway) will not lead to Chapter 7 in our current situation? Then, add in the problem of selling cars while a long (likely Chapter 7) bankruptcy works through the courts.\nIf you don't care about the loss of the domestic design and development control in autos, what do you think will replace this work and innovation? Are you a promoter of the race to the bottom philosophy?\nAusterity didn't work for Hoover, and it didn't work for FDR. And, we are blessed that the US is the biggest of the too-big-to-fail, hence the big money of the world is still forced to dump their cash into Treasuries. Treasuries provide a return, even if it's almost zero on the shorter stuff--that's still better than losing money. Treasuries are the way the world's big money gets stuffed under the proverbial mattress.\nLet's quasi-arbitrage this cheap money to find a floor so that things can get moving in the right direction. Hopefully, the Fed will work to lock in the maximum amount of cheap money for the longest terms possible.\nP.S.\nMaybe the foriegn companies were worried about quotas, like we had while Reagan was president, so they started assembling here.\nP.P.S.\nWe're like a developing country to the foriegn companies who assemble cars in the States. The home countries keep a lot of the high powered technology, innovation, and development: we do the grunt work.\nThey are getting better than us at the making advancements. That seems like it could be a long term problem. At least we're still blessed with a lot of domestic material resources, but we should probably look at our human capital relative to other developed countries. Maybe our material resources have made us overconfident; how much of our growth is the result of our commodity wealth versus our brilliance. Would Japan be so advanced if they had the crutch of a lot of domestic commodity resources?\nP.P.P.S\nFolks may want to read recent Sully posts (including dissents) about health care and pensions.\nNo PT Cruiser or Jeep Cherokee? Where do I sign up?\nSeriously, those are two utter piles of shit. Until recently so was the Mustang; now it's just a half pile of shit. It may look nice, but the suspension is outdated crap.\nThat aside, Ford isn't going under. They are actually getting their house in order. The only reason they showed up in DC is they heard free money was being handed out. Truth is, though Ford will never admit it, they will benefit if GM or Chrysler go under. Not only will it reduce the [over] supply of cars, it will give them incredible control at the bargaining table--in fact, they may just tell the Union to go to hell and hire scabs, which will be easy as pie.\nChrysler is the worse of the three and should have already gone under. The only thing decent they make is the Viper (which loses money) and the Dodge Ram Pickup (especially with the Cumins diesel, which Ford would love to get their hands on since their diesel engine isn't very good.)\nSomewhat recently I worked on a project that forced me to learn about GMs part distribution system. It's dreadfully \"designed\" and horribly inefficient. (By contrast, Ford's part distribution system is a dream.)\nPeople won't buy a car from a company that is in bankruptcy? Really? Did they not fly American while it was in bankruptcy? That seems a hell of a lot more perilous.\nIt's one thing to buy a car, quite another to put your life in the hands of a pilot.\nThis argument is absurd and spurious. Next, please. And, really. Try harder.\nJapan produces lower-cost cars because it has lower costs.\ntraditionalguy at 2:41, a lot of the military's vehicles come from AM General, which is not one of the Big 3, and not, to my knowledge anyway, involved in the bailout negotiations. They build the H2 Hummers for GM and would be hurt if they lost that marketing channel, but would they be hurt enough to have to shut down production of military vehicles? I don't know enough to say, but I doubt it.\nBradleys are built by BAE Land and Armaments, an international company with its US HQ in Minneapolis.\nIt's not WW II any more, when the auto companies turned the assembly lines over to military production.\nAirplanes, now, that might be another matter. Though the contract for tankers has not yet been given to Airbus; Boeing may yet prevail.\nThe auto companies are not going bankrupt - Congress will not allow it, except under some kind of hybrid bailout/bankruptcy that preserves union jobs and wages. Isn't it strange the auto companies have been bargaining as if they're in a position of strength? It's because they're as strong politically as they are weak financially.\nThe biggest benefit to bankruptcy from the auto companies' perspective is it allows them to renegotiate union contracts. There's no way the Democrats are going to cross the UAW like that, even if it means a permanent IV of taxpayer money into the sector.\nThe only real question is whether the Democrats bring enough Republicans along to make it a \"bi-partisan\" bailout.\nMy daughter tells me that the new ones are worthless and ugly.\nI don't think she'd drive a new Mustang if it arrived at Christmas with a big bow on the hood.\nShe wants an 80-something Camaro.\nWeird kid.\nThe Corvette is an amazing car; it's highest performance models are in many ways superior to cars manufactured by Porsche, Ferrari, Maserati and others.\nI look forward to the day when I can buy a new Corvette at a price that reflects a restructured GM's labor cost.\nThat being said, I miss and still yearn for the Nash Metropolitan. Gone, but never forgotten.\nThe new Republican Slogans for 2010:\n\"$700 billion for Wall Street but not one Dime for Detroit\"\nOr:\n\"American Workers Drop Dead - you make too much.\"\nShould be a winner.\nSeven,\nThat you are someone who would make a major durable good purchase of a car from a company that is broke, with an uncertain resolution (Chap 11 or 7, and gov $ or no gov $, and unknown macroeconomic expectations), says a lot about you.\nIf there were more folks like you it wouldn't matter what kinds of uncompetitive cars were produced domestically, some sucker would buy them anyway.\n\"all looted by ultra-conservatives eager to punish generations of American workers for the sin of not voting for the GOP in acceptable numbers\"\nActually the problem was that Democrats forced the US auto companies auto companies to build small cars that no one wanted to buy at a price that would allow the companies to make a profit. (Foreign companies could make those cars profitable for reasons that had a lot to do with more amenable labor unions.) But, all of the great cars will not disappear. In fact they will be on the roads for decades to come as people refuse to buy the cars Congress is going to design for Detroit to produce in return for subsidizing them.\nSynova,\nDoes she need a theme song ?\n\"American Workers Drop Dead - you make too much.\"\nShould be a winner.\nOf course it's not a *winner*.\nIt's just true. And truth isn't very popular.\nIt's much more popular to tell people that corporations are evil and have unlimited funds and there are no down-sides to making them pay you more.\nGranted, no one is saying that the auto-makers are victims. They dug their own hole.\nThe question is, should taxpayers bail out an industry that has been bailed out before?\nThe rant Ann quotes is pretty typical, it seems, of an argument that simply does not admit the existence of economic reality. No, it's just mean and vindictive motivations... the only reason that \"conservatives\" do anything. Hate.\nrcocean said...\nThe new Republican Slogans for 2010:\n\"$700 billion for Wall Street but not one Dime for Detroit\"\nYou seem to have forgotten that most Republicans did not vote for the Wall Street bailout. You also should note that most of the money donated from Wall Street went to Democrats. Also consider how many from the Clinton Administration were on Wall Street making millions per year. Think of Raines, Gorelick, and most of all Robert Rubin. How much of the $700 billion will go to George Soros, not a friend of Republicans? But, I think you have nailed another Democratic Party big lie.\nI am pro-bailout. Lending is the basis of our free economy. Without banking, everything else falls apart quickly. See, for example, the Great Depression, when for years Roosevelt and Hoover kept money tight, further constricting a constricted economy.\nI am convinced that people on the fringe left and fringe right simply do not understand economics. How else could you possibly believe that the way to save a struggling business is to keep it exactly in a position where it is losing money? If the unions and management wanted to solve their problems, they could do so, easily. They don't, though, so to hell with them. Bankruptcy law is there for a reason.\nFinally, what's so special about the auto companies? Nothing. Not one thing. What about General Growth. They own malls. Mall are vital for shopping. What about Fred's Bakery and Big Schlong's Porno Emporium? Why not those businesses?\n\"What about Fred's Bakery and Big Schlong's Porno Emporium? Why not those businesses? \"\nDonuts and porn - there will always be demand.\nTalk about too big to fail-- Fred's and Big Schlong's going out of business would truly be Black Swan events.\nI'm finally reading Amity Shlaes' book on the Great Depression, \"The Forgotten Man.\" Two of her complaints with FDR and the New Dealers were their insistence on making business the scapegoat, and the effect of his \"bold, persistent experimentation,\" both of which frightened investors into keeping their money on the sidelines due to the persistent uncertainty.\nSeems like the opposite is taking place now. We have people like this Kos diarist, a leftist, who gets teary-eyed thinking about GM, Ford and Chrysler and can't imagine life without them. It's Feel-o-nomics.\nI suppose Feel-o-nomics creates another kind of uncertainty. Companies could make the tough choices to survive in this economy. Or they could create a wave of sentimental nostalgia and hope they can use that to get a bailout.\nWhich other businesses would the left give a sentimental bailout? Here are some \"deserving\" candidates:\nApple\nStarbucks\nThe Simpsons\nThe New Yorker\nPatagonia\nThe Boston Red Sox\nBurt's Bees\nCBS\nWham-O (makers of Frisbee and the Hula Hoop)\nAmerican Spirit Cigarettes\nNike\nI have always thought that John Stodder was one of the most sensible and intelligent posters on the Althouse blog. But to suggest that the Boston Red Sox deserve a bailout can only mean one thing.\nYou sir are a communist.\nWhole Foods\nGoogle\nBen and Jerry's\nMSNBC\nHarper Collins\nThe New York Times\nCan't let any of these irreplaceable companies fail.\nBut to suggest that the Boston Red Sox deserve a bailout can only mean one thing.\nYou sir are a communist.\nJohn Cusack and Ben Affleck love them and would be very upset if anything ever happened to them. I realize they're profitable now, but you can never be too sure. They deserve at least $2 billion.\nChip Ahoy said... basic analysis is correct, save the motive was not to screw the middle class, but enrich the wealthy further. The mechanism was the informal Bretton Woods II, where American Elites agreed to let cheap Asian labor wipe out manufacturing and depress wages in services and thus give themselves 10 digit GNP Growth. In return they would expect to honor the dollar's dominance and give America's Elites, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors, a cut of the action on the recycled Dollar.\nIt was a brainchild of ultraconservatives in the Reagan Administration. America would then be the \"knowledge economy\" where we would have all the IT workers and the experts the Asians needed to make their new ex-American industries prosper. And they thought we would dominate new technology, like cell phones, fiber optics, plasma screen TVs.\nAnd all the Asian dollars ploughed back in could go into Gov't, which would allow supply side conservatives to massively grow the Government under Reagan AND cut taxes.\nIt worked, just like someone quitting his job to be a poker player and using his inheritance and home equity to get a big line of credit. Meaning - it worked for a while. The middle class was told, despite their huge unease about factory after factory closing, that \"Exciting\" new jobs were coming. The losses had little to do with the manufacturing or services jobs being union or not. The only criteria was if Japan, then later China, Pakistan, Indonesia, and India could do it cheaper than the American.\nThe trade deficit exploded. More unease. The masses were told \"real estate!\" was the answer - nothing need be made in America anymore but houses and \"the small niche military market that needs domestic product.\"\nNow the crap has hit the fan.\nI don't care if John Cusack, Joan Cusack or your ball sack loves them, there is one thing that is perfectly clear:\nBOSTON SUCKS!!!!!!!!!\nAnd that dweeb Ben Afleck dumped a hot chica with a sweet ass for a skinny buck tooth sckank so what the hell does he know about the price of beans.\nWhat is Burt's Bees?\nThe 140000 UAW members don't make all that much more than the non-unionized workers at the foreign transplant factories. The bulk of the almost $30/hr difference is benefits, which I believe includes retiree benefits. If all the UAW members work a 2000 hour year, the aggregate extra cost to Detroit is around $8 billion per year. GM should have gone Ch11 a few quarters ago when they became technically insolvent but still had the cash reserves to get through it. Ford will probably be OK and its interesting that of the Detroit 3, they are the ones with a product guy in the lead, even though his signature product is the Boeing 777. Chrysler is private and not too big to fail. Their IP of any value - mostly Jeep - will be sold and soldier on.\nAnd the US will still not get a clue that we need to make things and incent and respect who can and do.\nBen and Jerry's?\nMaybe not.\nThis place in Seattle had it's Ben and Jerry's replaced with Red Mango.\nAt least they still have two standalone Starbucks, plus one in the QFC, and another one in the Barnes and Noble--I did mention this is in Seattle.\nWhat is Burt's Bees?\n\"Earth friendly Natural Personal Care for the Greater Good.\"\n\"At Burt’s Bees, our goal is to help create a world where people have the information and tools they need to make the highest ethical choices and do the best for themselves, their families and the environment.\"\nTheir signature product seems to be some kind of organic lip balm, but they also make shampoo, skin creme, cologne, etc. The lip balm works pretty good.\nInteresting that liberals comprise most of Red Sox Nation, since the dirty secret is the Sox were the last team to be integrated -- fully 12 years after Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers.\nYet my Dodgers seem to have no cachet among the glitterati. Our most famous fan is Alyssa Milano.\nBoston teams have always been the most racist teams in every sport. It is just typical of the liberal hypocrisy that they pretend that it isn't so.\nThis is of course not such a big issue anymore since black athletes won't play baseball anymore.\nOh and Alyssa Milano sucks!!!\nBut in a good way.\nA very very good way.\nIf Cuba can have the same American cars forever, so should America.\nQuick, Congress, put yourself in charge and make this wish come true!\nI am feeling the fuzzy, cooling effects of Burt's Bees lip balm as we speak. It's a miracle product, really, particularly in a cold Chicago winter.\nU use it all the time. I have friends who are addicted to the stuff.\nI use it all the time. Typos can ruin a good joke.\nI always get more edumicated here. It pays to ask if you don't know something.\nI have a tube of Bert's Bees lip balm. The kids may steal my Chapstick but they never steal my Bert's Bees. My husband asked to use it once and was very sorry. I don't like it either. Bleh... smells like perfume.\nChap Stick is a lot better than it used to be.\nThen there is good old Carmex.\nJust never put it through the washer and dryer. Trust me. Worse than crayons.\nFord is anti-gay. I hope they go bankrupt.\nCalifornia, too, Downtown. And virtually every other state, and nation.\nThe auto industry is 4% of US GDP. Over $500 billion a year.\nSure you can let it go bust, but the cost will be a hell of a lot more than $35 billion.\nYes, I hope California goes bankrupt too. I hope your whole fucking country goes bankrupt.\nI'm enjoying your Depression.\nDowntown -- What nation with stunning GDP growth do you call your own?\nI've said it before - but I really do think that the bankruptcy of the Big 3 would be a great capstone in George W. Bush's legacy.\nPlease let it happen.\nThe worse shape the economy is in on January 20th, the more breathing room Obama will get to enact his agenda.\nMy country enjoyed double digit growth last year.\nI'll start calling myself an American again on January 20th.\nSane people don't wish ill on their own country.\nIf you actually do care about the US economy though, it is important not to let these companies go under.\nNobody's buying cars because people are worried about the economy. They are worried about their jobs and their savings. So they make their existing cars go farther. That causes the economy to slow or shrink. But they can only make their cars go so far. Eventually they buy new ones and that helps the economy grow. Well if these companies aren't here, the US will never experience the rebound will. Japan and Korea will instead.\nThat might be good for the world's economy, but I'm not sure its good for the US. Those jobs, 11% of the world's manufacturing industry, will be gone forever.\nI think they should do some sort of restructuring, maybe allowing one of them to go under and get absorbed by one of the remaining 2.\nHere is a tip for you if you lost your job and need to make some money. Bet big on Oklahoma in the BCS championship game vs. Florida.\nYou can make some money too on Penn State in the Rose Bowl and I bet Texas Tech will win too though I am not sure who Texas Tech will be playing.\nAJ Lynch - It's not my country. I've already left. US voters have made it very clear that they don't want gay people living there.\nHmm DTL I must have missed that ballot question....what did it ask something like \"Are you in favor of gay people living in the USA?\"\nJust what we need, to follow the economic prescriptions of a raving lunatic who believes that the world revolves him and his gayness.\nYes Seven - Your economic policies, practiced by George W. Bush - have just done wonders for this economy.\nAJ Lynch - when you pass constitutional amendments that say \"Gays are now second class citizens\" that's exactly the message you are sending to gay people - that they are not welcome in your midst.\nFine. I listened. Now I get to laugh at your Depression. I had a smile on my face when I read Friday's jobs report.\nEnjoy your \"time abroad,\" Downtown. As someone who knows quite a bit about consular law, I can assure you that it's tremendously difficult to renounce American citizenship. So, when Obama becomes president, and everything automatically becomes rosy again, we'll welcome you \"back\" with open arms.\n\"I'll start calling myself an American again on January 20th.\"\nThat's nice. We, however, will continue to call you an insufferable, needy, sociopathic faggot.\nI'm not renouncing my citizenship. I still have to pay taxes, and even if I renounced my citizenship - I STILL have to pay taxes for 10 years.\nThat's why I still vote. But I don't have to live there. And my earnings and income are now helping the economy of another country.\n\"My country enjoyed double digit growth last year.\"\nWhat, in the sex tourism industry? They should offer you a medal for, uh, single-handedly causing that windfall.\nAt least I have a job Palladian. And I'm not fat. And I have friends.\n\"And my earnings and income are now helping the economy of another country.\"\nHow many Thai boys can you buy on 45K a year?\nPalladian - Next to gaypatriot - the most self-loathing gay person in America.\n\"At least I have a job Palladian.

Now we realize that you don't like Asians either.\nShocker.\nI am betting that Downtown is hunkered down in his efficiency in Chelsea right now, masturbating with seething hatred.\nI feel sorry for gay people who are fat. Gay men care a lot about looks.\nIf I was in Chelsea right now - I'd be out drinking with my friends.\nNow I'm heading off to the gym.\nBye.\nBye Seven.\nYou might want to know that the mask you are showing in your profile is quite popular in gay S&M clubs.\nGood day.\nYeah, I'm sure my mask is popular at gay S&M clubs. You'll see guys wearing it all over La Lucha in Mexico City, just for example.\nI thought you were leaving. What happened? You can't quit me, I guess.\n\"Palladian - Next to gaypatriot - the most self-loathing gay person in America.\"\nHaha. I'm not self-loating. I loathe you.\nWhen did you finally come out of the closet? When you were 45? That's funny. See, I've been \"out\" since I was a teenager in conservative rural Pennsylvania, back when being \"out\" actually carried some risk. At the same time, you spent those years on your knees in restrooms and alleyways all the while pretending to be straight during the day because you were too much of a pussy to be honest with yourself and the world. And now that everyone responds to gayness with a shrug and a yawn, you're suddenly SUPERFAGGOT! Hurling SUPER POWERED insults with impunity and anonymity at those of us who dare \"disagree\" with you! Able to repulse and sicken people, straight and gay, with a single blog comment!\nYou're pathetic, Mary.\n\"We already know that you didn't vote for Obama, solely because he's black. Now we realize that you don't like Asians either.\"\nI know! I even wore my Klan hood and carried a burning cross to my polling station in a public school in south Brooklyn. And those fucking Asians! Man I hate them! I'm calling my Taiwanese and Japanese friends right now to tell them how much I don't like them!\nI don't care. Every American car I've bought, including the Saturn, has been a disappointment.\nThe trucks were OK, but still not as good.\nThe sad thing is my Toyota Corolla was made in Georgia.\nIt's not American workers that are the problem. It's American car companies. If American workers are building Toyotas, they seem to do a better job.\nJeeps have been built by: Bantam. Ford, GM, Willys, AMC, Chrysler, Mercedes (Daimler) and now a hedge fund. I expect that Jeep will end up somewhere, the more important issue for sports car and muscle car people is what will happen to the Connor Ave. Viper plant? I would also expect Corvette and Mustang to survive, with the high-end Corvettes as their American competition and Porsche as their primary European competition Viper does not have an easy road. Viper also doesn't seem a logical fit for any of the world's majors except for Toyota and their Toyota Racing Division, however Toyota has their own problems. I've been musing that maybe Viper could end up being owned by a group of (or individual) wealthy Viper Club members. Viper is no Pierce Arrow, but they are America's most outrageous modern cars.\nI wish I were in Chelsea right now.\n\"I wish I were in Chelsea right now.\"\nLondon, New York or Clinton?\nPretending she was my intern heh.\nSo this gay guy walks into a bar full of nine-year-old boys in Thailand. Chelsea Clinton is there. Bartender says, \"Hey pal,...\"\nThere's a punchline here. I'm just not able to think of it.\nHave to be something like \"Hey Pal see anything you like?\" then segue to the punchline where the gay guy sees Chelsea and says \"what a coincidence Chelsea Clinton is here; it was women like her mother who turned me gay!\".\nChelsea stomps out of the bar, and he says, \"There goes the neighborhood!\"\nGM is becoming hysterical about bankruptcy. Yes, sales would decline, but Chapter 11 reorganization will give them flexibility they need to fix many of their problems. They know this and I could understand them being worried, but why do they keep acting like it's the end of the world?\nMy theory; GM is not only in far worse condition than they are letting on to anyone outside a tight inner circle and has committed criminal fraud hiding that fact. Bankruptcy will expose all the dirty laundry and people will go to jail.\nMy 88 Dodge Colt is suffering predictable breakdown. Piece of junk. Cars don't last 20 years anymore.\nMade by Mitsubishi, which I chose because of their aircraft experience.\nAnd try finding a Zero these days.\nAJ Lynch said: Plus the Janps and Asians buy very few of our cars? Why is that?\nDuh. The Japanese don't buy American cars because they drive on the left side of the road.\nDuring the post-war occupation and reconstruction it was decided by GHQ to retain Japan's left-driving to discourage the American Auto industry from flooding Japan with American cars.\nIronic, eh?\nIn the early postwar years, with passenger car production restricted by GHQ, motorcycles and three-wheelers played an enormous part in meeting the demand for motorized vehicles in Japan. In fact the Bank Of Japan didn't think an auto industry was necessary which gave rise to MITI and keiretsu.\nGHQ also decreed that Allied vehicles would be rebuilt and repaired by Japanese firms to bootstrap the industry, who carefully studied our work methods and repair techniques, adapting and refining them.\nToyota developed JIT not from studying our auto industry but Piggly Wiggly, another irony.\nEvery competitive advantage the Japanese learned; we taught them. You might want to Google W.F. Taylor, Frank Gilbreth, and especially W. Edwards Deming.\nStupidly, we did not apply the knowledge to our own industry. The Big 3 crash & burn is way over due and as others have commented they did it to themselves.\nBTW-Denso Corp is GM's top supplier, don't fret, the Japanese will take a hit as well.\nAmerican vehicles needed to have been built better. I think that is the core of the problem. In 1984 I bought a Chevy truck, no frills, three speed on the column, probably the last one made. No air conditioning. Within 2 years the paint started to fall off. I mean big pieces after a rain. I painted it last summer, and there was no paint on the cab and hood. Some paint left on the bottom parts. I've had to replace the generator, starter and brakes, which was no big deal, and did the work myself. It's been reliable for 148,000 miles. Except for the paint, which limited the resale value, almost immediately.\nNext up, I bought a 1998 Chev S-10, and had to replace the clutch after 80,000 miles, again, at 120,000 miles plus some transmission parts. Sometimes you could get it into 4 wheel drive, sometimes you couldn't get it out. Everything broke on the car, and by 1997, it was a piece of rust.\nBecause I had a 55 mile drive to work, and was closing in on retirement, I spent $8500 on a GEO Metro. Made in Canada it has been a blessing, and is still going strong at 168,000 miles. I have to replace the exhaust system about every 4 years, but do the work myself, so it's relatively inexpensive.\nI remember when I got out of the Army in 1968, and my father bought a brand new Dodge truck. The worse piece of crap made. Needed a new engine after only 20,000 miles, and by 60,000 miles was a rusted piece of junk.\nThat's why Detroit is having problems.\nDang! Make that \"I bought a 1989 Chev S-10\"\nThat's why Detroit is having problems.\nQuite a while back I heard Phil Condidt (of Boeing) tell a story about transmissions. Apparently the Ford Ranger and Mazda pickup used the same transmissions. Both companies had the exact same specs, but the Ford built transmissions had reliability problems. The engineers tore apart the two transmissions but their precise measuring tools couldn't detect any difference.\nAfter further study they found that the Japanese transmissions were more perfect than the measuring tools could distinguish. This extreme precession was necessary for that particular transmission design.\nP.S.\nHe also said that China told Boeing they would not buy planes unless a lot of the construction took place in China. We would never want to put pressure on foriegn companies who want access to our markets, that's not free trade.\n1jpb: Exactly. This Deming page will further illustrate the point. Ford did not seek Deming's advice until 1981, the Japanese had a thirty year head start at that point.\nOur auto industry is not competitive because we have not made it so, all of us are responsible, the customer who buys iconic marketing and accepts lesser quality as long as it is \"cool\".\nManagement, shareholders, unions and politicans are mutually culpable. They began to see the auto industry as a means to produce wealth and votes; the Milo Minderbinder approach.\nWhen better quality, fuel efficient and/or hotter iconic alternatives were offered the public switched in staggering numbers. Still the Detroit dinosaur lumbered on, adding more overhead baggage and producing cars years behind the imports; unaware or incapable of accepting that the import asteroid was about to render them extinct.\nDetroit had a serious heads up in the 70's. Ford responded with the more fuel efficient Taurus-Sable cars of the mid and late 80's. GM and Chrysler plodded on through the morass of too many badges, low quality and Congress grandstanding with unrealistic federal regulation time frames; all larded with executive merit bonuses, dividends and labor benefit packages until they finally reached the edge of the insolvency tar pits.\nI have extended family members who will be negatively impacted if GM is forced into bankruptcy, but the cost per unit of management and labor must be reduced to make the industry competitive. They must then address the issue of quality control, CAFE goals and most importantly plant realignment and retooling, the mother of all of money-sucking tar pits on Detroit's horizon. Retooling alone will take 4-5 years. Our pockets are not that deep, soon the taxpayer, if not already, will be tapped out. Then what? Bankruptcy.\nDo it now, accept the short term pain, before it becomes a Sisyphean task.\nPeople won't buy a car from a company that is in bankruptcy? Really? Did they not fly American while it was in bankruptcy? That seems a hell of a lot more perilous.\nNot really. Once you've made your flight, you've received everything American owes you. If you buy a car from a company in bankruptcy, how can you guarantee a supply of spare parts and service? What about warranties? Ask Peugeot, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo owners what it was like when they abandoned the US market.\nTo those saying US cars are crap, have you been to an auto show this year? The latest batch of new GM cars, like the Pontiac G8 and Cadillac CTS, are light years ahead of GM's past efforts. Interior quality and design is top notch, GM's powertrains are a good as ever (never slam GM's engineers), and ride & handling is as good as anything out there. I currently own a Lexus, but I'm seriously considering a CTS, it's that good.\n\"Rice Burning\"? Very intelligent journalism there. How ignorant! The American auto companies have had plenty of time to correct their ways, but instead thought it best to rest on their pathetic American laurels. \"We're Americans. We practically invented the car so we don't need to be taking advice from any other country's business practices.\" Typical American mentality. And now look where its gotten you. It's an eat or be eaten world and the American automakers have just been served up with a side of steaming rice."}
{"text": "Diagram that! is the implicit challenge from Gertrude Stein – whose sentences are devilishly devoid of commas..\"\n74 comments:\nI can vividly remember diagramming sentences in 5th grade for Sr. Louise. Good stuff!\nGertrude Stein, one of those incredibly great writers that nobody actually wants to read.\nJust remember: There is no there there.\nNow, you're ready to impress people at a party.\nShe's the Frank Zappa of writing. Every musician, and rock fan feels compelled to proclaim that Zappa was a genius, but nobody actually wants to listen to his music.\nProclaiming the greatness of Stein and Zappa proves you're an intellectual.\nThe titles to his songs are, however, great. I suggest reading the titles and ignoring the songs.\nThe fact that language is so incoherent the fact that people no longer diagram sentences is due to.\nGertrude Stein gets her new iPhone.\nI diagrammed sentences in Catholic school and didn't do it again until a linguistics course in college. They were similar experiences. Very boring, but probably there to give humanities majors the same sense of consistent but trite accomplishment math majors get when they solve problems.\nSuck on a comma, Gertrude.\n...\n--\nAnd going through my university's English program, I never met a single professor who thought Stein was anything other than a stammering retard. She's venerated because she owned the saloon that all the great ex-pats hung out at in Paris. She's the kid everyone pretends to like because her parents are never home and has a fridge stocked with soda and a downstairs with a Super Nintendo AND Sega Genesis.\nFor a couple years I was an English major -- until I married and started worrying about how I might put food on the table -- and I enjoyed diagramming sentences. It was relaxing work, a lot like working a sudoku puzzle; I didn't find it exciting. I feel sorry for anyone whose life is so dull that diagramming a sentence would qualify as exciting.\nWhich reminds me of a story: When I was in high school I told my uncle I was going sky diving later that summer (subsequent events conspired to make the sky diving adventure impossible). My uncle asked why my friends and I were going sky diving. I told him it was for the excitement. My uncle, who had jumped out of perfectly good airplanes during the war, replied: \"Excitement? When I jumped out of a plane, the guys shooting up at us provided the excitement. The jump itself was peaceful.\" Everything's relative.\nTry again --\nKids are not taught to diagram sentences anymore(adverb), even in the best of schools. That's why young people today can't write worth a damn. They don't know grammar, and they don't know how the parts of speech (What's that?) work together.\nIt's a shame.\nGertrude Stein stepped off the Oakland trolley\nAnd fell into a void;\nShe shoulda stayed on the IRT\nAnd got off at toid and toidy toid.\nInteresting post. Earlier I was thinking about how sentence diagraming must be used in Siri to breakdown the different permutations of saying the same thing.\nNew Testament Greek must have been fun written in all capitals with no punctuation and no spaces.\nI guess if you want to hear the message, then you will work at it..\noops--was = would\nShe uses them instead of question marks, though, because she hates them even more!\nBeing Gertrude Stein, she would prefer a question martha to a question mark anyway, wouldn't she? I'm sure there's a masculine angle that can be teased out of her hatred of commas. It probably has something to do with that little phallic sarif.\nRe; Zappa\nThe titles to his songs are, however, great. I suggest reading the titles and ignoring the songs.\nDitto. Zappa is to rock what the Church Of The SubGenius is to religion.\nCommas and question marks are tools, and should be used as needed. While I'm sure it's perfectly feasible to craft a cabinet without a table saw, for instance, not only will the work be more difficult but the end result not nearly as true. An unwillingness to use available tools speaks more to misplaced self-confidence than actual skill.\nErik: enjoyed your comment and agree with most of it--having watched the dude on PBS that works with 19th century tools, I think there is a certain art in using hand tools.. I am guessing you are an outcome guy rather than a process guy :)\nYou might enjoy this.\nA serif could always be misinterpreted as a hanging chad and then LOOK OUT!\nAm I the last lover of the semi-colon?\nIt is a compromise mark. Half comma and half colon; Sort of transpunctuation.\nIt's tedious putting a question mark where the words have already made it a question. I like a question mark where it transforms the words into a question. I like a working question mark, not a slacker, conventional question mark.\nwhat Trad guy said--the semi-colon may be the last bastion of those that learned three rules of punctuation.\nI expected diagraming wasn't being taught when we ended up with slogans like Think Different.\nProfessor--as a matter of interest, am I to assume that your 1Ls are to take a course in legal writing? I think that is a good thing, but would love to hear your take on it.\nI suspect, Professor, that you are not a math major. I can assure you that learning to use the chain rule in calculus is equally exciting as the use of LaPlace transform in differential equations.\nClearly different strokes--albeit with the same outcome.\nThe older parsing mostly replaced by syntactical analysis.\nBut interesting little-knwon factoid--Miss Stein and her beloved Alice were....nazi sympathizers! (ie Vichy), at least for some time. Althouse kind of gal.\nAnd Shouting OneNote pretending he knows something about music again. Predictable.\nshe owned the saloon\nDon't you mean salon? or did she own a bar?\nAm I the last lover of the semi-colon?\nNope. I use it, albeit sparingly, in fictional narrative. I don't think I've ever used it in dialog. Think about how a sentence with a semicolon would sound...\nCarol: the difference between a salon and a bar is probably a function of the clientele--as a matter of preference I prefer saloons over salons. the clientele is more straightforward.\nScottM--I think in the case of a semi-colon it would be a visual thing--agree that using a semicolon on spoken language would not be particularly significant.\nEvery once and a while when going back to edit, I'll see a couple of sentences that are too long and can be combined down into a single sentence with a semicolon. It's always like finding a little Easter egg. I consciously try not to overdue it, though.\nThe Alt-tards on ..punctuation. Wow. Deep. Stick to the meth labs and yr favorite occultist books, dreck.\nScottM: IIRC the semi-colon is used to tie together two independent clauses. And is also used to follow a conjunction (eg, however) when followed by another independent clause--and finally used when the author has put forward a string of statements wherein the last one separated by a semicolon from the preceding statements. Works in the written format; however, less so in the the oral form where it would be impossible to discern the difference.\nThey use the semi-colon a lot in the NBA; it's called traveling.\nricpic: thats a damn good visual--thanks\nScott M. said\n\"I consciously try not to overdue it, though.\"\nI think spoken language and written language are related. For instance,if I want to add punctuation to a spoken sentence, I might choose to do it this way.\nIs this what you mean?\nJ, you seemed to have lost that old creepy spirit for a while. The insults, racial and anti-semitic slurs just don't have the same bite.\nI haven't been able to even excite your usually excitable wratth.\nUntil now.\nI was worried about you. I thought that you might be slipping into the final stages of syphillis, but I see you are in remission.\nLive for today! La-la-la-la-la-la, Live for today!\nAaaahhhh!\nOf all the things to hit us with on a Friday afternoon.\nHow about some story problems, too?\nAnd what Allen said.\nRoger J. said....\nAnd you were always asking for her help in understanding where your sentence structure went wrong.\nAnd hers went right.\nah edutcher--you are on to my game--it was great when she leaned over me.\ngave new meaning to the term \"direct object(s)\"\nTouched a nerve. Back to yr evinrudes, yokels.\nShouting Yokel---you're the diseased illiterate derelict here, trash .Not to say congenital liar. And I know perfectly well who youve been chatting with. Yr new queer LDS palsie's messages won't help out when your case goes to court. Comprendes, basura\nJ: its comprende. Take the infinitive comprendar, to understand. drop the ar ending and replace it with e. that makes it imperative in the second person.\nthis isnt hard Its the imperative form. does not require an s at the end\nGrow up asshole--you are a real piece of shit Concentrate on learning at least one language reasonably well--you havent demonstrated that capability well.\nbasura is of course spanish for trash--but a more grammatically correct form would be (in formal spanish: tu eres basura. thats a complete sentence.\nbetter hurry with your trash talk J--got a 5:30 tee time and not much time to fuck with you.\nI wrote, in an earlier thread about disposing of a family portrait, that we enjoy having our little inheritances around us and that some day, someone would regret the painting was burned.\nMy wife, whose grandmother skipped out on her marriage to hang with The Bloomsberries, has a photograph of her infant father being bounced on Stein's knee - the imagination can run free when viewing!!\nGrandmother was ruined by a fiduciary who pilfered, then margined her Trust, which calumny was revealed in the 1929 Crash.\nWhich has nothing to do with scanning sentences (that I recall taught by Mrs. Kingdom in Grade 5) and everything to do with anonymous advantage-taking on a Forum.\nsuffer tea-tards,eh fools gladly.\nHeh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh\nAhh J: and your incomprehensible entry responds to what exactly? What is it about the english language that escapes you?\nQuickly son--I got a tee time coming up--say something intelligible\nRogerJ said:\n\"J: its comprende. Take the infinitive comprendar, to understand. drop the ar ending and replace it with e. that makes it imperative in the second person.\"\nI believe the verb is comprender, with an \"er\" in place of an \"ar.\" Therefore, it is:\nYo comprendo,\nTu comprendes,\nEl, ella, usted comprende.\nSo J's usage was of the second person familiar.\nDrug test time, soon Atards\nToday I ran across and English workbook from 1956. I remember it well. I loved diagramming sentences. I love puzzles, diagramming a sentence is just like a puzzle; putting everything in its proper place. I follow family members, many nieces and nephews, their children and grand children on FB. I cringe a lot because most of them say Anyname and I as an object of the preposition. Am I an old fuddy duddy? It's all I can do to keep from correcting them.\nRoger J. said...\nah edutcher--you are on to my game--it was great when she leaned over me.\nI'm sure she warmed your heart.\nJoe--you are absolutely correct--thanks for setting me straight--but isnt the issue the imperative form of comprender?\nedutcher: she warmed more than that :)\nJust as a matter of curiousity: has anyone here ever actually read a book by Gertrude Stein or known someone who has?.....I think Gertrude was being cool and ironic with that diagramming sentences obervation. In real life, she probably found working a strap on with Ernest infinitely more exciting than diagramming sentences. Although, to be fair, it was probably more fun than making out with Alice B. Toklas.\nI never diagrammed one.\nFurther, just from that sample, I can tell Stein's not that good of a writer.\n(Would she have any fame at all today if not for her sexuality?)\n(Contra Thomas, I like Zappa and listen to his music voluntarily. The key is that nobody wants to listen to his experimental music. The pop-shaped stuff is fine.)\nStein was an avante-garde type that influenced others, especially Hemingway.\nShe wrote stuff, but its rightly been forgotten.\nDiagramming isn't done because it's not a good analysis.\nOpen Quirk Greenbaum et all to a random example and try to explain it with diagramming.\nI highly recommend that 2000-page book. Take a summer to disabuse yourself of the idea that things are governed by rules that you know.\nUtterly at random:\n\"It is with duration adjuncts that we have greatest freedom to use noun phrase, though for the most part they can be regarded as abbreviated prepositional phrases and can be made more explicit and rather more formal by the introducton of for:\nThey stayed (for) a while.\nThey lived (for) several years in Italy.\nWith or without for, time units can be postposed by round (with years) or through, especially when the reference is habitual:\nThe Stewarts now stay in Italy { the whole summer through, the whole winter long, the whole year round, all the year round. }\nWithout a numeral or other quantifier, the for can often not be omitted:\n?*He put up the night at a hotel.\nBut:\nHe stayed the night at a hotel.\nHe put up that night at a hotel....\"\nTheir aim is to tease out the real rules. Diagramming doesn't help at all.\nThousands of pages like that.\nGertrude Stein's arrogance about punctuation would carry a bit more weight if she written better prose. Unfortunately it was her writing that was weighty (i.e. ponderous), and her objection to commas was mere bitchiness.\nGertrude Stein + Essay = Leaden Drivel\nN.B.\nHere's another uncomfortable fact of life that makes feminists crazy: A man can gracefully age from a wit and raconteur into a curmudgeon. Women can't do this. They try to be witty and come off bitchy. Then as they age they morph from bitches into batshit crazy cat collectors. Women have never done wit; they don't get it, never have and probably never will. It's hormones or something. Even women who get paid to be witty crash and burn like the Hindenburg every time they attempt the bon mot. Think I'm off my chump, do you? Just listen to Janeane Garofalo for three minutes without chemical protection. Case closed. (BTW, I wonder how many cats Ms. Garofalo owns now.)\nI, too, diagrammed sentence after sentence in junior high. I didn't mind it, but I don't know that I got much out of it, either. It was ninth grade Latin that finally -- for some reason -- brought the parts of speech and how they cooperated, together.\n[Please note the important comma.]\nPlease note the important comma.\nCome to think of it, I only wish I could have justified a semi-colon, if only to annoy Mme. Althouse. Alas, grammar wouldn't allow it.\nHomeschooling Mom here who made all her kids diagram as part of their grammar instruction. They're teens now, so it's been awhile, but interest was recently renewed when our son's best friend's Mom (who is a H.S. English teacher), as a fun exercise/challenge, diagrammed the first sentence of Dickens Pickwick Papers.\nShe showed her work to me the next morning in church. Who else can she show it to? I still have it.\nIf we didn't homeschool I'd want my kids to be in her class. Gotta love teachers who do for fun on the weekend what they do for pay during the week.\nTools are handy. This doesn't mean each tool is useful in every situation. It also doesn't mean that because a tool isn't useful in every situation, it's not useful at all. Learn how to use tools and when to use them (or not), and you'll go far.\nI've always enjoyed diagramming sentences. I like puzzles and computer programing; diagramming sentences seems to be part of a similar process.\nJ keeps saying it's drug test time, but he never tells us what his results were. Of course, it's easy to see why.\nJ keeps saying it's drug test time\nWell, it if IS drug test time, I demand to be given some drugs to test.\nHow can I test drugs if I don't have any?? The 1% have drugs....damnit...kick some down!!!\n\"She's the Frank Zappa of writing. Every musician, and rock fan feels compelled to proclaim that Zappa was a genius, but nobody actually wants to listen to his music.\"\nI think Zappa sucks, outside a small body of his early work with the original Mothers of Invention. That said, Zappa's fans are legion and they are fanatical...and they do listen to his music.\nI always preferred Captain Beefheart.\nGertrude Stein eats shoots and leaves.\nThere's a link for \"the implicit challenge\" but it's broken."}
